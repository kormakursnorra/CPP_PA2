# Assignment Overview

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to implement data structures typically found in standard libraries of programming languages, focusing on manual memory management.

## Allowed
- Use the following headers:
  - `<cassert>`
  - `<cstring>`
  - `<cstdio>`
- Use functions such as:
  - `strlen`
  - `strcat`
  - `strcpy`
  - `atoi`
  - `atof`
  - `memcpy`
  - `assert`
- Implement data structures for integers or template them to support all types.
- Use previously implemented data structures for building new ones.
- Test your data structures using compiler flags, gdb, and valgrind.

## Not Allowed
- Use any STL data structures (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::set`, `std::list`, etc.).
- Rely on built-in data structures; you must manage memory manually.

## Submission
- Submit a single ZIP file containing all code files (.cpp and .h).

## Important Notes
- Ensure proper testing to avoid incorrect results and memory leaks.
- Document time complexities and exceptional cases for each operation in the README or as comments above function declarations.
